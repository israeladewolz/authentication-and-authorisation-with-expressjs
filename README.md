# User Management System

This project implements a basic user management system that includes user authentication, authorization, and functionality to delete users. Below is an explanation of the security considerations surrounding the user deletion functionality.

## Understanding Authentication vs. Authorization

### **Authentication**

Authentication involves verifying who a person is. It ensures that the user logging in is indeed the person they claim to be. This is achieved through credentials like a username/password, token, and many other forms of identification.

- **Example**: You log in to a website using your username and password, and the system checks if your credentials are valid. If they are, you are authenticated.

### **Authorization**

Authorization, on the other hand, determines what an authenticated user can do. It controls the access and permissions that a user may have within the system. Authorization occurs after authentication and ensures that only certain users are able to perform specific actions.

- **Example**: After logging in, you could be allowed to view your profile, but only the admin would have the privilege of deleting a user from the system.

## Requirement Evaluation

### **The Issue with Allowing Deletion After Authentication Alone**

Allowing any authenticated user to delete other users means that any user who successfully logs in could potentially delete other users. This approach does not involve checking the user's privileges or roles, leading to a significant security flaw.

### **Why This is Not the Ideal Mechanism**

#### **1. Lack of Role Controls**

Authentication alone does not differentiate between user roles, such as a normal user versus an admin user. Without authorization, any authenticated user will have access to administrative functions like deleting users. This could be easily misused and, in worst-case scenarios, exploited to disrupt the system.

#### **2. Security Risks**

If any authenticated user is capable of deleting other users, it opens the door to malicious users. Malicious users could take advantage of vulnerabilities to delete users at will, which could lead to data loss, system instability, or breaches.

#### **3. Principle of Least Privilege Violation**

Security best practices recommend the **Principle of Least Privilege**, which states that users should only be given the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks. Allowing deletion based purely on authentication violates this principle, as it grants excessive power to users who should not have such capabilities.

#### **4. Granular Control**

Authorization provides granular control through **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. With RBAC, only users with specific roles, such as admins, are allowed to delete users. This prevents ordinary users from performing critical actions that they should not have the authority to execute.

#### **5. Protecting System Integrity**

Authorization ensures that even after authentication, users are only allowed to perform the actions that their role permits. This adds a layer of security to protect sensitive operations, such as user deletion, from being executed by unauthorized users.

### **Conclusion**

In the context of user deletion, relying solely on authentication is a **bad idea**. **Authorization** should also be implemented to control access to critical functionality like deleting users or making updates to sensitive parts of the system. Together, authentication and authorization answer the questions:
- **Authentication**: "Who are you?"
- **Authorization**: "What are you allowed to do?"

Both are essential components for building a secure system.
